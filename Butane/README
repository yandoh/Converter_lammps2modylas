# This document describes how to convert *.data file created by 
# the Winmostar into .mdff and .mdxyz files readable by modylas program.
#
# Note: Convert_gaff_nspecies.py and Convert_mdff_nspecies.py are new scripts
#       generalized for a n-component system (n=1,2,3,...).

Case (1): without shake condition

python ../Convert_gaff_nspecies.py butane_1400.data
=> butane_1400.mdff and butane_1400.mdxyz will be generated.

python ../Convert_mdff_nspecies.py butane_1400.mdff
=> butane_1400.mdff.rearranged and butane_1400.mdxyz.rearranged will be generaged.


Case (2): with shake condition for X-H bonds

python ../Convert_gaff_nspecies.py butane_1400.data shake
=> butane_1400.mdff and butane_1400.mdxyz will be generated.

python ../Convert_mdff_nspecies.py butane_1400.mdff
=> butane_1400.mdff.rearranged and butane_1400.mdxyz.rearranged will be generaged.


For both (1) and (2) cases, in butane_1400.mdff.rearranged and butane_1400.mdxyz.rearranged, 
order of atoms is rearraged so that shake pairs relevant to the same heavy atoms are closed with a segment.
